# PokeCatch Clicky Game
Can you catch all the Pokemon?  Let's put your Pokemon Trainer skills to the test with this memory clicky game.

## What is this?

This is a simple memorization and click game. The object of the game is to click on only one Pokemon once.  If you repeat guesses, you lose and the score is reset to 0. Highscores from each attempt are kept dynamically in the browser as well. You win by reaching the max score total of 12.

## How to Play:
- Open the app/game: https://jsf5077.github.io/PokeCatch/
- Click on any pokemon card you to catch them
- The cards will all reshuffle themselves
- Click on another pokemon, but don't click the same one twice!
- Keep going to see if you can get all 12.
